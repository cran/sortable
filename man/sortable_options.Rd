\description{
Use this function to define the options for \link{sortable_js} and \link{rank_list},
which will pass these in turn to the \code{SortableJS} JavaScript library.
}
\details{
Many of the \code{SortableJS} options will accept a JavaScript function. You can
do this using the \code{htmlwidgets::JS} function.
